This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.0.


## Prerequisites

Both the CLI and generated project have dependencies that require NODE: '18.15.0' or higher, together
with NPM: '9.5.0' or higher.


## Installation

**BEFORE YOU INSTALL:** please read the [prerequisites](#prerequisites)

### Install Locally
```bash
npm install @angular/cli@16.1.0
```

To run a locally installed version of the angular-cli, you can call `ng` commands directly by adding the `.bin` folder within your local `node_modules` folder to your PATH. The `node_modules` and `.bin` folders are created in the directory where `npm install @angular/cli` was run upon completion of the install command.


## Development server


Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
